* HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

    * To produce the same graphs and results from the report, please make sure to run each cell in order.

    * Make sure to have these libraries!
    ------------------------------------------
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        import matplotlib as mpl
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    -------------------------------------------

    * There is also a pdf report that interprets the graphs and gives a brief summary of the analysis.
